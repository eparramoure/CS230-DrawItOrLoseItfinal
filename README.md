Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
We were in touch with the client who had a game called Draw It or Lose It. It was a web-based idea that the computer would generate an image and slowly draw it. The players would then have to guess within a limited amount of time. It is a multiple player game and was only available on Android at the time we started the project. They wanted it to be available on multiple platforms as well. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did a well with learning the aspects of the different operation systems and choosing one that would best fit the client’s and user’s needs.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
	The process of working through the design document was helpful when we created the UML design. It explained the connections between objects in the code better than you could understand by just reading it.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
	I would probably revise the client and server sides part of the document. I feel it lacks details and more information would have been helpful in my explanation. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	I read the requirements with each assignment, asked questions if needed, and explicitly made sure to include their desires in the code. It is important to include your user’s needs so that your application is complete and runs well.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
	For this class, I took lots of notes and looked at examples to help me understand the goals. In the future I would also utilize other examples of similar designs to help me learn more and follow current practices.
